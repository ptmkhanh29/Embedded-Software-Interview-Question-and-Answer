# Embedded Software Interview Question and Answer
Below are the questions and answers that I did during my interview review.

**1. What is Static variable?**
**Answer:** Static variables are allocated at compile time, and remain in memory throughout the program's lifetime. 
- If static variable declares within a function. Now, It is local static variable -> It retain the value between function calls.
- If static variable declares for a function name. Now, it is static function -> It only visible in the file where it is declares.
- If global static variable -> Can only accessed in the file where it is created.
